The analysis will focus on the number of matches won. This project is divided into two key objectives:

1. Analysis of relevant parameters:
General performance of the teams.
Team with the most matches won per tournament.
Team with the most goals scored.
Team with the most matches won historically.

2. Creating a new dataset to develop an interactive Tableau dashboard.
   
A dataset that is too extensive can be problematic for visualization in tools like Tableau. To optimize this process, a new dataset is created and made available for anyone who may need it.
